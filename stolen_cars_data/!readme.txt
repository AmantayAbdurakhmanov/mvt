Limitations of the data
Stolen vehicle information listed here is a snapshot of data taken from the Police vehicle of interest database. Police are unable to guarantee the accuracy of this information. For example, there can be a delay in stolen vehicles appearing and in recovered vehicles being cleared from the list. Some vehicles listed as stolen may have been located but Police haven’t been advised.

Stolen vehicle information from these lists should not be relied upon exclusively when assessing whether or not a vehicle might have been stolen. Suggestions for steps prospective purchasers could take to check whether a vehicle is stolen are available from organisations such as Consumer Affairs and Neighbourhood Support.

This data does not include lost or stolen registration plates;
